AUTHOR NOTES:
    - layout for mobile, iPad* and desktop
    * but there's a certain width between resizing from desktop to 976-ish px that messes up the layout. I'm not sure how to fix it.
    * but for targeted screens, layout is responsive
    - used flexbox and grid
    - used span 5 times for the stars, let me know a better way to do this.
